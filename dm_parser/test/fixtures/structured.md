# Hello Testers

This is a test of how a <span class="highlight">document</span> with various _types_ of structure is evaluated.

## Types of structure

Types of structure include:

- Lists of items
  - as well as sub-lists of course
- Heading levels are probably the most obvious
- Block elements like <div>div</div> are also an important items
- but what about _inline_ elements like <span>span</span>?

## Deep Thoughts

I actually have run out of deep thoughts but wanted some more nesting

### Deeper Thoughts

Yup i'm cheating a bit here:

- foo
- bar
- baz

But what can I say ... is cheating that works really <span class="foobar">cheating</span>?

#### Deepest Thoughts

Here we go again.

- foo
  - f1
    - ff1
    - ff2
    - ff3
  - f2
  - f3
- bar
- baz

```ts
const foo: string = "bar";
```

## That's all Folks

Ok that's all for this fixture.
